# Cognitive Aspects of Human Computer:Communication Strategies
## Project Overview
The DineSmart project is a comprehensive application of the 22 cognitive design principles learned in the course on "Cognitive Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction."
The goal is to design a website focused on recipes and food blogging, where the primary objective is not the content but the demonstration of effective website design through the integration of cognitive principles. These principles include aspects of perception, memory, judgment, and user interaction, all aimed at enhancing user experience.
### 1.Loss Aversion - Framing
Design Choice: A banner at the top of the homepage stating, "Don't miss out on our exclusive recipes—Subscribe now!"

Screenshot: A header banner with bold text and a call-to-action button.




Reasoning- This framing leverages loss aversion by making users feel they might miss out on something valuable if they don't subscribe.
###  2. Loss Aversion - Endowment Effect
Design Choice- A free trial offer for premium recipe collections with a call-to-action, "Try our premium recipes free for 7 days!"
Screenshot- A section on the homepage with an eye-catching button offering a free trial.

Reasoning- By allowing users to try premium content, they begin to feel ownership, increasing the likelihood they will continue with a paid subscription.
###  3.Loss Aversion - Number of Choices
Design Choice- On recipe category pages, limit the display to 60”Page 1 of 60 results” featured recipes with a “Next” button.
Screenshot- A category page showing 6 highlighted recipes with a button for more.

Reasoning- This reduces decision fatigue and helps users feel more satisfied with their selection, avoiding regret over unchosen options.
###  4.Judgment - Anchoring
Design Choice- Display original prices crossed out next to the sale price for any premium features or recipe bundles.
Screenshot- A product page with a visible price cut, showing a higher original price crossed out.

Reasoning- Anchoring influences users' perception of value, making the discounted price seem more attractive.
### 5.Judgment - Availability
Design Choice- Showcase testimonials from well-known chefs and food bloggers prominently on the homepage.
Screenshot- A testimonial section with recognizable names i.e “Chef Marcus Samuelsson, James Beard Award-winning chef and author” and photos.

Reasoning- Displaying familiar names helps users trust the quality of the site’s offerings, enhancing perceived credibility.
### 6.Working Memory - Phonological Loop
Design Choice- Simplified navigation with a maximum of seven main menu options.
Screenshot- The top navigation bar with seven menu items i.e Home,Pages, Features,Categories, Archive, About and Contact.

Reasoning- Limiting options prevents cognitive overload, allowing users to navigate the site more efficiently.
### 7.Working Memory - Visual Semantics
Design Choice- Use four distinct visual elements per page, such as an image for the logo, text block, button, and icons I.e social media profiles.
Screenshot- A typical page layout with balanced visual elements.



Reasoning- This design minimizes cognitive load, making it easier for users to process and navigate information.
### 8.Working Memory - Episodic Buffer
Design Choice- Include a section where users can recall a previous dining experience to select recipes based on a theme or occasion.
Screenshot-A search or filter tool that asks users to select from past dining experiences or recipe for example below search for “How can I prepare fried rice?” .

Reasoning- By triggering memories of past events, users can more easily navigate choices, even when more options are presented.
### 9.Working Memory - Capacity; Processing Tradeoff
Design Choice- Ensure that contact pages are clean with minimal text and clear, large font buttons.
Screenshot- A contact page with a clean, straightforward layout.

Reasoning- A clutter-free design allows users to focus on conatcting and processing their purchase without distractions, reducing errors.
### 10.Color - Basic Color Perception
Design Choice- Use red, green, and blue prominently in action buttons and alerts (e.g., “Subscribe” button in pink).
Screenshot- The “Subscribe” button in pink with red alerts for errors.

Reasoning- Using primary colors ensures that important elements are quickly recognized and acted upon.
### 11.Color - Maximum Contrast
Design Choice- Implement high-contrast colors, such as white text on a black background for headlines.
Screenshot- A header with BLACK text on a WHITE background.

Reasoning- Maximizing contrast improves readability, ensuring key information stands out.
### 12 Color - Color Blindness
Design Choice- Avoid red/green combinations for key interactive elements, using black/white or yellow/blue instead.
Screenshot- Interactive elements like buttons or links in orange/white, blue/yellow or black/white combinations I.e the Send email button below with orange/white color combinations.

Reasoning- This design choice ensures that the website is accessible to users with color blindness, improving usability.
### 13.Sensory Memory - Iconic Memory Capacity
Design Choice- Use a high-quality background image of a dining table or a well-prepared dish as the homepage’s background.
Screenshot- The homepage with a background of an elegant dining setup.

Reasoning- A strong visual first impression captures attention and sets the tone for the user's experience.
### 14.Trust
Design Choice- Include an external platform widget for reviews, such as likes,comments,Google Reviews e.t.c on the product pages.
Screenshot- A product page with an embedded likes and comments for rating as shown below.

Reasoning- External reviews are perceived as more authentic, fostering trust and credibility with the user.
### 15.Past Experience
Design Choice- Use familiar menu structures and iconography that users have encountered on similar recipe or e-commerce websites.
Screenshot- A navigation menu that mirrors common structures seen on food or retail websites i.e the humburger menu shown below.


Reasoning- Leveraging past experiences ensures that users can navigate the site with ease, reducing the learning curve.
### 16.Movement
Design Choice- Add subtle animations to highlight call-to-action buttons or when transitioning between pages.
Screenshot- A GIF of a button that slightly enlarges when hovered over.

Reasoning- Movement draws attention to key actions and improves engagement without overwhelming the user.
### 17. Hit/Miss
Design Choice- Implement a clear search bar that instantly shows relevant results as the user types.
Screenshot- The search bar showing real-time results as a user types a recipe name.

Reasoning- This design ensures users can easily find what they’re looking for, increasing the “hit” rate and reducing frustration.
### 18.Correction/Rejection
Design Choice- Include clear messaging for unavailable items, with suggestions for similar available options.
Screenshot- A product page showing “Out of Stock” with alternative suggestions below.

Reasoning- This prevents user frustration by managing expectations and providing actionable alternatives.
### 19.Gestalt
Design Choice- Group related recipes and blog posts together visually using borders and proximity e.g drinks,multipurpose,desserts etc.
Screenshot- A section where recipes are grouped by category with clear borders around each group.

Reasoning- Gestalt principles help users quickly understand the structure and organization of content, making navigation intuitive.
### 20.Fovea
Design Choice- Position the most important call-to-action, such as the “Subscribe” button, towards the central part of the screen.
Screenshot- A close to centered “Subscribe” button in a prominent color.

Reasoning- Placing critical information where users naturally focus increases the likelihood of interaction.
### 21.Item Size
Design Choice-Ensure that buttons and text are large enough for easy tapping and reading on both desktop and mobile devices.
Screenshot- A mobile view showing large, easily tappable buttons i.e BUY NOW button.

Reasoning- Proper sizing enhances usability across different devices, preventing user frustration with small or hard-to-click elements.
### 22.Depth and Size Perception
Design Choice- Use shadows and gradients on buttons to create a sense of depth, making them appear clickable.
Screenshot- A button with a subtle drop shadow and gradient effect e.g the “Send message” button below.

Reasoning- These visual cues help users perceive the button as interactive, guiding them to click or tap.

This completes the application of the design principles to the "DineSmart" website, integrating both cognitive science and user-centered design techniques. Each principle enhances the website's usability, accessibility, and overall user experience, ensuring that users find it intuitive and enjoyable to interact with the platform. The reasoning behind each design choice ties back to core cognitive aspects, helping to justify the design decisions made for the site.
